## What I Learned

Two ways of adding an image on a web page:

- Using the `<img>` html tag
- Through `background-image` CSS Property

```HTML
<div
    style="background-image: url(./img.jpg);"
    role="img"
    aria-label="QR Code"
>
```

We should use the `role` and `aria-label` attributes to kind of provide information about the empty tag to screen readers, like `alt` attribute does (probably).

Besides this, I found out what a cool tool Figma is üë®‚Äçüé®

Firefox ü¶ä, it really surprised me how easily we can screenshot web pages.
